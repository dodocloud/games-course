# MI-APH course requirements

- **submit semestral work**
- **pass the exam**

## Semestral work rules

- implement a simple web game in **PixiJS library**
- the topic is solely up to you, a good source of inspiration might be [Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018)
- pay your utmost attention to the technical solution and **clean code**, it's more important than the actual gameplay


### Evaluation

- in order to receive maximum points, you must prove that **some effortful work went into your solution and you made up something senseful** 
- recommended amount of time is 50 hours of work
- the only mandatory part is the Component Architecture that will be part of the 3rd, 4th and 5th lecture
- you can use any additional 3rd party library (pixi-spine, matterjs, pixi-after-effects,...) yet it must be clear which part of the game you implemented on your own
- **maximum points: 50 (+6 bonus points)**
- **points to pass: 25**
- recommended topics/techniques you may choose from:
  - interesting AI
  - multiple scenes
  - advanced pathfinding
  - particle systems
  - advanced steering behaviors
  - integration of a physics engine
  - adaptive audio
  - advanced randomness (Perlin Noise)


### Instructions for submitting

- create your own repository under your username. The name should be MI-APH `gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/<username>/MI-APH`
- fork this repo to your own project. It's recommended to postpone this step until 3rd week - this repo will contain materials for component architecture by then 
- execute script `npm run clean_materials`, this will remove all materials, slides and other things not necessary for your semestral work
- your repository must contain ONLY your game and a PDF file with a manual
- the manual should contain a short **summary** of your solution, a **diagram** of the architecture of the game and a tutorial (if necessary),  it's size shouldn't exceed 2 pages!
- the diagram of the architecture is **mandatory**
- the game must be accessed by executing only those three steps: `npm install`, `npm run` and navigate to `localhost:1234/index.html`
- when you're done, assign access permissions to the lecturer (loginname svecadam) and write him an e-mail, informing that you have finished your work
- the deadline is set at **31.1.2020**. Please, be advised, that this deadline is crucial.
- therefore, **you can take an exam even before you finish your semestral work**

## Exam requirements

- only written part, **50 points** in total
- content from the slides (especially those marked with orange and red bulbs)
- single-choice questions (exactly ONE option will be correct), simple generic questions and exercises
- **25 points to pass**


## Final grade

- according to the Study and Examination Rules for Students of CTU 
- will be collected on [grades.fit.cvut.cz](https://grades.fit.cvut.cz/)

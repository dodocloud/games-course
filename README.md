## Architecture of Computer Games

- üéì 3rd year already
- üì¶ New slides
- üéÆ New examples
- üî• Live deployment


## Main focus of this subject

- methodologies from the viewpoint of game development
- component architecture and ECS pattern
- game mechanics
- dynamics and physics
- game AI, pathfinding
- scripting languages
- multiplayer

Development takes place in **PixiJS rendering library** in TypeScript

Lecturer's e-mail: [vesecky.adam@gmail.com](mailto:vesecky.adam@gmail.com) or [svecadam@fit.cvut.cz](mailto:svecadam@fit.cvut.cz)

Changelog is available [here](./CHANGELOG.md)

## What you may need to know

- everything is located inside this repository, **üôåincluding slidesüôå** , no external sources, no moodle
- tutorial explaining how to make this project work can be found [here](./docs/environment.md)
- requirements to finish this course can be found [here](./docs/requirements.md)
- assessment of semestral works and exams will be located on [grades.fit.cvut.cz](https://grades.fit.cvut.cz/)

## Materials

Upon every commit, gitlab will synchronize the content with a live environment in [AWS S3 Bucket](http://dodoworks.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/)

All slides were made by a modified version of [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). Its source code was rewritten into TypeScript and it's part of this repository as it may be constantly modified during the course.

Keyboard shortcuts for the slides:

| Key | Action |

| P | Previous slide |
| ‚Üê , H | Navigate left |
| ‚Üí , L | Navigate right |
| ‚Üë , K | Navigate up |
| ‚Üì , J | Navigate down |
| Home , ‚åò/CTRL ‚Üê | First slide |
| End , ‚åò/CTRL ‚Üí | Last slide |
| F | Fullscreen |
| ESC, O | Slide overview |
| CTRL + Shift + F | Search |

### Browser support

- RevealJS used as a presentation framework supports all browsers since 2012 (Chrome 24+, Firefox 4+, IE10+, Edge, Safari, Opera)
- custom styles were tested against Chrome 77 and Firefox 69 (Windows, Linux and Android platforms)
- if you bump into anything that appears wrongly aligned, or worse, broken, feel free to send an e-mail to the lecturer

### PDF Export

- yes, it is supported üôå
- you should use `Google Chrome` since it has got a built-in PDF export and the slides were optimized for it
- go to the dashboard (`index.html`) and click on `PRINT` label in the cell of particular presentation
  - alternatively, navigate to a presentation you want to export either on your localhost or live environment and put `?print-pdf` as a query string (e.g. `localhost:1234/lecture00.html?print-pdf`)
- in this mode, you will see all slides aligned vertically, stripped out of all visual effects and glowing backgrounds
- press right mouse button, select `print`
- select `Save as PDF` as the Destination, don't forget to check `Background graphics`
- wait for the preview to be generated and click on `Save`

- if you want to change the style of the slides (fonts, colors), more information can be found [here](./docs/environment.md)
